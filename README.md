# LOAD-CELL-USING-HX711-AND-ARDUNIO-UNO

A load cell is a sensor used to measure force or weight. It is commonly used in applications such as weighing scales, industrial automation, and robotics. Load cells are typically made of metal and contain strain gauges that change resistance when subjected to a force. By measuring the change in resistance, the load cell can determine the applied force or weight.

The HX711 is a precision 24-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) designed for weighing scales and industrial control applications. It is commonly used in combination with a load cell to accurately measure weight or force. The HX711 module provides amplification and analog-to-digital conversion for the load cell's output signal

To use a load cell with an Arduino, you will need additional components such as an amplifier or an instrumentation amplifier to amplify the small electrical signals produced by the load cell. One commonly used amplifier for load cells is the HX711.

To interface a load cell with an Arduino Uno using the HX711 amplifier, you can follow these steps:

#Step 1: Wiring the Components

Connect the load cell's output to the HX711 module's input pins: E+ to E+, E- to E-, A+ to A+, and A- to A-.
Connect the HX711 module's VCC pin to the 5V pin on the Arduino Uno.
Connect the HX711 module's GND pin to the GND pin on the Arduino Uno.
Connect the HX711 module's DT pin to digital pin 2 on the Arduino Uno.
Connect the HX711 module's SCK pin to digital pin 3 on the Arduino Uno.

#Step 2: Install the HX711 Library

Open the Arduino IDE.
Go to "Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Manage Libraries".
Search for "HX711" and select the "HX711" library developed by bogde.
Click on the "Install" button to install the library.

#Step 3: Upload the Code

Copy and paste the following code into your Arduino IDE:
